# Controllers
There are 4 available controllers that intercept and handle requests:
* [Search Controller]
* [Authentication Controller]
* [Events Controller]
* [Application Controller]

These 4 singletons are fully tested and can be verified using by running the `controllers` and `requests` test suite:
* Setup as described [here](../README.md)
* `cd` into the project directory(you should be here if you setup correctly)
* run `rspec spec/controllers` and `rspec spec/requests`
